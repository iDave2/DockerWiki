# DockerWiki

This project is an implementation of the multi-container pattern outlined
in Docker Docs'
[Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/07_multi_container/)
guide.
It targets developers and students.
For business applications, please find similar projects from
[Bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mediawiki) or organizations
whose context includes strong security, support, and all the things a
business needs to run.

A summary of what is here:

- `bin/backrest.sh`: simple backup and restore starter kit
- `bin/cake.sh`: build script to *make* and unmake artifacts
- `bin/*API.sh`: test scripts for related projects
- `.env`: build and runtime configuration variables
- `compose.yaml`: launch instructions for `docker compose`
- `config.yaml`: to be deprecated away
- `setEnv.sh`: shortcuts to simplify development and test

## Builds

`source setEnv.sh` for a build script that runs anywhere,
```bash
alias cake="/absolute/path/to/bin/cake.sh"
alias dc="docker compose"
```
When run from mariadb or mediawiki directories, `cake` only builds that image.
When run from the parent of those folders &ndash; that is, the project root
&ndash; `cake` builds both images:
```bash
$ cake      # create everything
$ cake -c   # destroy containers and images
$ cake -cc  # also remove volumes and networks
$ cake -h   # print usage summary
```
Build instructions were removed from `compose.yaml` when post-install steps
became complex. `docker compose` still launches DockerWiki provided it can
find the requested images locally or on the hub,
```bash
$ dc up -d                # create everything
$ dc down -v --rmi local  # destroy almost everything
```
Remember to backup important data before (accidentally) removing its volume!

## Backups

`source setEnv.sh` for a backup and restore script that runs anywhere,
```bash
alias br="/absolute/path/to/bin/backrest.sh"
```
`backrest.sh` backs up and restores three items:
- MariaDB database;
- MediaWiki images directory tree;
- MediaWiki LocalSettings.php file.

The working directory (option `-w` or `--work-dir`) is
optional for backup but required for restore:
```bash
$ br -b                             # -> /tmp/DockerWiki/backup-<date>/
$ br -bw ./my-git-backups/          # -> ./my-git-backups/
$ br --restore -w ./my-git-backups  # <- ./my-git-backups/
```

Latest images are pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/idave2) and no CI is configured (yet).

Docker is fun; five stars to the team.
